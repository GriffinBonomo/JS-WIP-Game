# JS-WIP-Game

> This is a game that is still in early stages of development. It uses the [JavaScript Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for graphical rendering and utilizes many of the techniques learned in my Game Programming course at John Abbott College.

The intention for this game is to fuse the stealth mechanics of games like [DEADBOLT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394970/DEADBOLT/) with the randomness and replayability of [roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) like [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/).

>Note: As I am a full-time Computer-Science student, development for this project is slow. I hope to focus more energy towards it once I have graduated / have more time on my hands.

### Planned Features
Some of features and systems I hope to implement in the near or distant future.

- A stealth system using light and shadow for concealment.
- Enemies and enemy pathfinding using the A* Algorithm.
- Randomized items and levels.
- Custom spritework for all levels.
- Integration with the [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor for more detailed and visually interesting levels.

### Current State

This game is subject to change in almost every way, current systems will be modified, removed, replaced, etc. I am very much still setting up the foundation for the game therefore, it is light on features at the moment. 
Game Dev is hard work, especially when you're making the bulk of the systems and functions by hand, that a game engine might offer out of the box.

I am excited for the challenges that I will face during development and to see how much this evolves over time.
