# JS-WIP-Game

> This is a 2D stealth game in early development that uses the JavaScript Canvas API for graphical rendering.

This game is heavily inspired by [DEADBOLT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394970/DEADBOLT/) and other 2D stealth games. 

>Note: I am a full-time Computer-Science student and thus, development is quite slow. 

### Features
Some features already included in the game:

- Dynamic lighting (includes coloured lights, directional lights and accurate shadow casting)
- Integration with the [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor for detailed yet easily modifiable levels
- Custom spritework for all assets

### Planned Features
Some of features and systems I hope to implement in the future:

- Multiple enemy types and immersive enemy behaviour (advanced pathfinding, communication, combat, etc)
- A stealth system using light, shadow and sound to distract / confuse enemies
- Multiple levels loosely connected by some form of story
- Data persistence (tracking current level, loadout, etc)

### Current State

The game currently features a demo level that the player can move through. It is simplistic and designed to test the lighting and shooting systems.
